After a long period of inativity, I resumed the construction of this site/blog. There is already a good time I'm working on it, and now the result is pleasing me. 

Here I will talk mainly about programming (the next posts are likely to be about Android), but the possibility of other issues are not discarded, as I have some thougts that I need to externalize (writing in a relaxed way). If everything goes well, all publications will be both available in Portuguese and English (don't take this as a promise).

As you stayed here until the end, take a look on my [portfolio](/about/). Any constructive feedback will be appreciated :)
