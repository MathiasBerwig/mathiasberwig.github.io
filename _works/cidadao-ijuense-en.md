One of the attractions of the [ExpoIjuí Fenadi](http://expoijuifenadi.com.br/) was the Open Tech Space, which promoted activities in the field of technology. Among them, it was held the first Hackathon in the region, which had the issue "Facilitating community contact with the citizenship". It was aimed to the development of tools to aid the resolution or mitigation of basic problems of the municipality, in order to bring more convenience to people's lives.

The developed application allows the user to choose a request category, provide the location of the event using the GPS device, attach a photo and describe the problem. The request can be sent to the responsible department identified with name, phone, and email; or anonymous. The project was rated the best of the competition, getting the 1st place prize.
