During the academic week of my university, I was invited to present an one night course about Android programming. Mission given, mission accomplished. During the course, I talked about the differences between the mobile and desktop applications, the Android framework and environment, the Android Studio IDE, emulator and project workflow, besides a little about Git. The presentation and the source codes are both available for download:
